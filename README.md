I made this program as an assignment for my Java class. It will take user input until they enter in a sential value. 
The sentinal value in this program is the word "exit". I used nested loops, True/False flags and a if else statements. 
I also made all input from the user into lowercase so the program will run without a lot of issues. I am planning on 
working on this further and building on it to make it look for more and run more optimized.
